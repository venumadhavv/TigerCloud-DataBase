                    image - is just like machine
 
                   now your total problem is solved--

                 
                      Why docker then ?

                 DOCKER- IS a advance version of virtualization
                           job of docker is to do containerization


                what is the problem with virtualization ?

                          above three probles
                             1- cant create unlimited vms
                             2- sepearte os means licensing cost
                             3- wastage of resources

                      this problesm is solved by docker
